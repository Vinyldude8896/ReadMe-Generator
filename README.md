# ReadME.MD Generator

### User Story
As a User, I would like a command line application that will generate a README.md file. When I start this application I should be prompted for information I want in the readme file. After answering all of the prompts I would like a README>md file generated with the information I supplied. 
### Features
This is a command line application that takes input from the user.
